# chatRoom
This is an implementation of a simple chat room in java. Users can join the room by running MyClient and providing a username. Other users can text each other by first
typing in the name of the user they wish to message. In order to text a different person, the user can type new chat and imput the new person's name. To exit the chat 
room, the user can type exit. This implementation currently only works on localhost.
